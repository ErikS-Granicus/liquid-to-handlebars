  This snippet controls the collage collection grid.  Depending on the number of
  collections we want to display them in rows of 1, 2, or 3.

  You will have at most 2 rows of 2 items and the rest should be rows of 3

  The pattern applied to collections is:

  1 = full width
  2 = 2 row
  3 = 3 row
  4 = 2 row, 2 row
  5 = 2 row, 3 row
  6 = 3 row, 3 row
  7 = 2 row, 2 row, 3 row
  8 = 2 row, 3 row, 3 row
  9 = 3 row, 3 row, 3 row
  10 = 2 row, 2 row, 3 row, 3 row
  11 = 2 row, 3 row, 3 row, 3 row

  Change the grid item width by using classes from the grid in
  the grid_item_width variable.

  Example:
    - {{assign 'grid_item_width' 'large--one-third medium--one-half'}}

{{assign 'previous_index' (minus collection_index 1)}}
{{assign 'remaining_length' (minus collection_count collection_index)}}
{{assign 'previous__remaining_length' (minus remaining_length 1)}}
{{assign 'remaining_divisible_by_three' (modulo previous__remaining_length 3)}}
{{assign 'image_size' 'grande'}}

{{#if (lt collection_index 4)}}
  {{assign 'is_three_row' false}}

  {{#comment}}
    check to see if the remaining items are divisible by three
    after the first row of 2.
  {{/comment}}
  {{#if (and (is previous_index 2) (gt remaining_divisible_by_three 0))}}
    {{assign 'is_three_row' true}}
  {{/if}}

{{/if}}

  Once we have set the first 4 items in the grid we can
  place the rest in rows of three
{{/comment}}
{{#if (gt collection_index 4)}}
  {{assign 'is_three_row' true}}
{{/if}}

{{#comment}}
  If the total number of collections is divisible by 3, use 3 rows
{{/comment}}
{{#if (is divisible_by_three 0)}}
  {{assign 'is_three_row' true}}
{{/if}}
{{#if (is is_three_row false)}}
  {{#comment}}
    If we are on the first collection we need to set the small BP column width
    depending on whether the total number of collections is divisible by 2.

    Or we want to set the width to one-whole if it is the only collection being
    shown.
  {{/comment}}
  {{#if (and (is collection_index 1) (is remaining_length 0))}}
    {{assign 'grid_item_width' 'one-whole'}}
    {{assign 'grid_item_responsive' true}}
  {{else if (and (is collection_index 1) (gt divisible_by_two 0))}}
    {{assign 'grid_item_width' 'one-whole medium--one-half large--one-half'}}
  {{else}}
    {{assign 'grid_item_width' 'one-half medium--one-half large--one-half'}}
  {{/if}}
  {{#comment}} Set item with to half if it isn't in a 3 row. {{/comment}}
  {{include 'collection-grid-item'}}
{{/if}}

  If we set is_three_row to true based on the
  conditionals above.
{{/comment}}
{{#if (is is_three_row true)}}
  {{#comment}}
    Assign grid classes for 3 rows.

    If we are on the first collection we need to set the small BP column width
    depending on whether the total number of collections is divisible by 2.
  {{/comment}}
  {{#if (and (is collection_index 1) (gt divisible_by_two 0))}}
    {{assign 'grid_item_width' 'one-whole medium--one-third large--one-third'}}
  {{else}}
    {{assign 'grid_item_width' 'one-half medium--one-third large--one-third'}}
  {{/if}}
